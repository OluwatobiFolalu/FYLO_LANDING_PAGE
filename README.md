## My process
I built the Nav-bar using regular CSS styling elements with inline-block and other positional properties.
I also used the position relative and absolute to define the placement of the elements on the first, and second section of the page, particularly the images. 
I used CSS grid property for the thrid section and the footer however. 
I also used CSS flex properties to pistion some items side by side such as the contact details in the footer and "See hoe fylo works" section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge of how to use positional properties as well as grid and flex box propertie
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about positional properties, and how to work with Grid and Flexbox elements too
